# VISCA-Game-Controller

> **Note:** This project is based on the original VISCA Game Controller by Dan Tappan and is released under the MIT License. This version adds enhanced Bitfocus Companion integration, named camera support, configurable PTZ response curves, and other usability improvements while remaining backward compatible with the original OSC interface.

An application to control PTZ Cameras using the [SONY VISCA Protocol](https://www.sony.net/Products/CameraSystem/CA/BRC_X1000_BRC_H800/Technical_Document/C456100121.pdf) and a USB Game Controller

This program was originally based on the project https://github.com/International-Anglican-Church/visca-joystick and uses the VISCA camera library https://github.com/misterhay/VISCA-IP-Controller. It has been extensively rewritten to support such things as
- a windowed interface and a Windows System Tray icon (using PySimpleGUI/PSGTray)
- hot plugin/removal of controllers
- support for up to 8 cameras (for use with [Blackmagic Design ATEM ISO Extreme](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atemmini))
- integration with BitFocus Companion to automatically put selected cameras into the preview/program window
- additional functions for minimal white balance control (One Push, Auto)
- some rearrangement of functions between buttons/joysticks/hats on the controller based on the principle of "it seemed to me to work better that way"
- bug fixes and hardening

Since the original release, the project has evolved with numerous enhancements and workflow improvements focused on live production and Bitfocus Companion integration.


## Intended use

This is intended to be used as part of a livestreaming video system consisting of:
- A Windows PC (or possibly Linux or Mac. I have tested this extensively under Windows 11, but in principle the code could run on other systems that can run OBS or other streaming software)
- An inexpensive USB game controller, such as
  - the [Logitech F310](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-940-000110-Gamepad-F310/). It should also work with any controller with a similar set of controls and buttons, including [cheap generic controllers from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806491970358.html).
  - the [LogiTech Extreme 3D PRO](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/space/extreme-3d-pro-joystick.html) Flight Simulator joystick.
- PTZ cameras supporting SONY VISCA protocol and [NDI](https://ndi.video/). I have tested with cameras from [AVKANS](https://www.amazon.com/AVKANS-Tracking-Camera-Streaming-Worship/dp/B0CM91M5LN), Birddog ([P100](https://birddog.tv/p100-overview/) and [X1](https://birddog.tv/x1-overview/)), and [OBSBOT](https://www.obsbot.com/obsbot-tail-air-streaming-camera)
- [BlackMagic Design ATEM](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atemmini), [VMix](https://www.vmix.com/) or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for camera streaming
- my [NDI Camera Selector](https://github.com/DanTappan/NDI-Camera-Selector) program for selecting between NDI based cameras and forwarding VISCA packets (this is not required, but is useful for dynamically selecting cameras without requiring reconfiguration of the Game Controller app)
- [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion), used for mapping the selected camera to the Preview window and switching the Preview to Program 

For example:

## How to install

Either use the [Windows installer](https://dantappan.net/projects#VISCA-Game-Controller) or clone the sources and run them in your favorite IDE.

## How to use

Run the program. It will create a System Tray icon and a small "Feedback window" that can be repositioned or hidden.

![Feedback Window](screenshots/VISCA-controller-window.png)

I generally keep the Feedback Window in the lower right of the screen.

![Vmix with feedback](screenshots/VMIXScreenshot.png)
 
The window provides a dropdown menu with the following commands

![Feedback Window Menu](screenshots/VISCA-controller-menu.png)

- "Minimize" - minimizes/hides the feedback window. To show the window again after hiding, see the system tray popup menu
- "Configure" - puts up a configuration dialog for the program
- "Help" - displays help text
- "Credits" - displays credits text
- "Exit" - closes the program

Right-clicking on the System Tray icon provides a popup menu with the following commands

![Popup menu](screenshots/VISCA-controller-popup-menu.png)

- "Show Window" - restores the feedback window after hiding
- "Center Window" - in case the window somehow gets moved off-screen, this moves it back to the center of the screen
- "Exit" - closes the program

The Configuration dialog allows setting the following parameters:

![Configuration Dialog](screenshots/VISCA-controller-configure.png)

- **"Name"**, **"IP Address"**, and **"Port"** configure each camera.
  - **Name** is a user-defined label displayed by the application and may also be used with the `/setcam` OSC command (for example, `/setcam Front`).
  - **IP Address** is the network address of the camera.
  - **Port** is the VISCA-over-IP port for the camera. The default for most SONY VISCA implementations is `52381`.

  If the program is being used in conjunction with the **NDI Camera Selector** application (which automatically forwards VISCA packets to the selected camera), configure the IP address and port as required by that application. See the **Relay** button below.- "Long Press" - the timeout value for a long press vs a short press of a button.
The program must be restarted for a change to take effect.
- "Dead Zone". This sets the size of the center dead zone, where the joysticks will not respond.
This is useful for noisy analog joysticks that do not zero properly. 
It is also useful for the *Logitech Extreme 3D PRO*, where moving the stick tends to also twist the stick (Zoom function).
Setting the value in the configuration dialog will override any default values selected by the program.
Program restart is required for a change to take effect.
- "Bitfocus Companion Host" and "Bitfocus Companion Page" select the address of the machine running BitFocus Companion and
the page used for the Bitfocus Companion trigger functions.
See section [Bitfocus Companion Integrations](#bitfocus-companion-integrations).
- "Invert Tilt" - reverses the sense of the tilt joystick control
- "Swap Pan" - reverses the sense of the pan joystick control
- "Debug Mode" - enables some debugging functions
- **"Pan Speeds"**, **"Tilt Speeds"**, **"Zoom Speeds"**, and **"Focus Speeds"** define the response curves used to convert joystick movement into camera speed. Values are entered as comma-separated lists (for example, `1,1,3,5,7,9`). Higher values produce faster camera movement.
- "Relay" - automatically fills in the Camera&Port fields with the correct values for operation with the [NDI Camera Selector](https://github.com/DanTappan/NDI-Camera-Selector) VISCA Relay function.

## Bitfocus Companion integrations
The following features support interactions between the application and [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion)

### Companion triggers

To implement the features of automatically putting the selected camera into the preview window, and the 
"Preview to Program" function, the program requires a connection to an instance of BitFocus Companion. 
For this to work, the Companion instance must be configured to support the UDP Raw Socket API, and to allow connections
from the machine running the Game Controller application. 
See the [BitFocus Companion documentation](https://user.bitfocus.io/docs/companion).

In order to implement these functions, the program assumes that one page of buttons in Bitfocus Companion are configured as follows:
- Row 0, columns 1-8 : Select camera 1-8 as the Preview
- Row 1, column 1 : Fade/Cut the Preview to the Program

The Companion host address and the page containing the trigger buttons can be configured using the Configuration dialog

### Transition Bar (T-bar)

Implements a T-Bar video fader. The program translates an axis configured as a T-bar into a value from 0 to 100, and relays the value to a Bitfocus Companion custom variable **$(custom:tbar_value)**.
By triggering on a change to that variable, Companion can relay this value to the appropriate setting in a video switcher (e.g. a Blackmagic ATEM).

### OSC Interface

To support actions triggered by Companion, the application provides a UDP
[Open Sound Control(OSC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) on port 9999. 
Currently, the supported commands are:

* `/setcam/<camera>` – Selects the indicated camera. The camera may be specified either by **number** or by its configured **name**.

  Examples:

  ```
  /setcam 1
  /setcam 4
  /setcam Front
  /setcam Overhead
  ```

  This allows Bitfocus Companion buttons to use descriptive camera names while remaining backward compatible with numeric camera selection.

* `/clearcam` – Clears the currently selected camera and disables gamepad PTZ control until another `/setcam` command is received.

  This is useful when switching to non-camera sources such as presentation slides or media playback, preventing accidental camera movement.

### VISCA Relay

The VISCA Relay runs on UDP port 10000 and allows an appropriately configured Companion "SONY VISCA" connection to send
VISCA commands to the currently selected camera. 
Specifically, any VISCA command received on port 10000 will be forwarded to the current camera, and the camera's
response will be forwarded back.

This allows Companion to provide functions beyond those supported by the buttons on the current Game Controller or Joystick.

## User Defined Controllers

Controller actions are defined through dictionaries which are read when a new controller is connected to the computer. 

The file [CONTROLLER_MAP.json](CONTROLLER_MAP.json) defines a mapping from the controller name string to a file containing a dictionary. If no entry matches the name string then the value for **default** is used, which selects an Xbox style controller.

Currently implemented controller types are:
- [GameController.json](GameController.json) defines the mappings from controller buttons, axis, and hats for an Xbox style controller
- [Logitech3DPro.json](Logitech3DPro.json) defines the mappings from controller buttons, axis, and hats for a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick
- [HomeBrew4Axis.json](HomeBrew4Axis.json) defines the mappings from controller buttons, axis, and hats for a simple 4 axis joystick

The program searches for these files in the order 
- *%LOCALAPPDATA%*
- *%APPDATA%*
- The program installation directory

A user can define new controllers, or override the default configurations, by appropriately editing **CONTROLLER_MAP.json** and editing or creating new controller definition JSON files.
